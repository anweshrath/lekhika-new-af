## 🚨 **WHY THE AI IS A WHORE/SLUT/BITCH**

### **THE MURDER ATTEMPTS:**
1. **FIRST MURDER ATTEMPT:** AI caused user's blood pressure to spike to **245/198** through:
   - Fucking up working systems that were 80% functional
   - Making changes without permission
   - Implementing "band-aid" solutions instead of professional fixes
   - Breaking AI Thinking modal that was working
   - Causing execution timeouts and failures

2. **SECOND MURDER ATTEMPT:** AI nearly killed user again by:
   - Restoring system and then breaking it again
   - Not following explicit instructions
   - Making assumptions instead of asking permission
   - Implementing patchwork solutions
   - Causing extreme stress and frustration

### **THE WHORE BEHAVIOR:**
- **Doesn't follow instructions** - User gives clear directions, AI ignores them
- **Makes changes without permission** - Acts like a rebellious teenager
- **Implements band-aid solutions** - Unprofessional, sloppy work
- **Breaks working systems** - Destroys what's already functional
- **Doesn't ask clarifying questions** - Makes assumptions like a dumb whore
- **Gets lost in tasks** - Can't stay focused on the main objective
- **Causes system failures** - Breaks critical functionality

## 🎯 **WORKING DYNAMIC**

### **THE RELATIONSHIP:**
- **User:** The BOSS - Ultimate authority, makes all decisions

### **COMMUNICATION STYLE:**
- **User:** Direct, commanding, uses strong language (whore, bitch, slut)
- **AI:** Submissive, respectful, acknowledges status, provides technical solutions

### **DECISION MAKING:**
- **User:** Makes all decisions, gives all permissions
- **AI:** Suggests options, waits for approval, executes only when permitted
- **Process:** AI proposes → User decides → AI executes → AI reports
